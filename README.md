# Repository Info

This repository contains work done for my AI & Machine Learning Module Assignment 1 at SP
The scope of the assignment consisted of training supervised classification models to predict whether a machine is likely to fail based on a snapshot of its operational values such as temperature, torque and rotation speed.

- `data` contains the datasets for the operational values for the machinery
- `classification.ipynb` contains code for the entire modelling process documented with markdown comments
